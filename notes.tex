\heading{Paging}
One of several methods of implementing virtual memory. Divide physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called page frames (size is power of 2, usually between 512 bytes and 8192 bytes). Divide logical memory into blocks of same size called pages. Keep track of all free frames. To run a program of n pages, need to find n free frames and load program. Set up a page table to translate logical to physical addresses.
\subheading{Address Translation Scheme}
\textbf{Page Number} (p) - used as an index into a page table which contains base address of each page in physical memory\\
\textbf{Page Offset} (d) - combined with base address to define the physical memory address that is sent to the memory unit
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pageTable.png}
\subheading{Implementation of Page Table}
Page table is kept in main memory. The two memory access problem can be solved by the use of a special fast-lookup hardware cache called associative memory or translation look-aside buffers (TLBs)
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{TLB.png}
\subsubheading{Page Faults}
If the TLB entry doesn't exist, then load it into the table
\subheading{Memory Protection}
Memory protection implemented by associating protection bit with each frame.
\subheading{Segmentation Faults}
Segmentation Fault arises when: Accessing invalid memory page, Trying to write to a read-only page.
\subheading{Shared Pages}
\subsubheading{Shared code}
One copy of read-only code shared among processes. Shared code must appear in same location in the virtual address space of all processes.\\
\subsubheading{Private code and data}
Each process keeps a separate copy of the code and data. The pages for the private code and data can appear anywhere in the virtual address space.
% TODO: add page table calc examples
\subheading{User-space vs Kernel}
The operating system controls the address ranges (pages) a process can use. It does not decide how that space is used. Management of those pages is the responsibility of the process (Usually vie standard libraries).

        output = fdopen(fdOutput[1], "w");
    }
}
return
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\heading{Threads}
A process may have multiple threads of control. Threads share code, data, open files etc (they have separate control flows).
\subheading{Threads vs Processes}
\subsubheading{Similarities}
Each has its own logical control flow. Each can run concurrently. Each is context switched.
\subsubheading{Differences}

\heading{Shared Data}
\textbf{Global variables} - one copy per process\\
\textbf{Local variables} - one copy per thread\\
\textbf{Static variables} - one copy per process
\subheading{Critical Section}
A critical section of a thread is a segment of code that shouldn't be interleaved with another thread's critical section. \textit{Note that these threads could be in different processes.} Concurrent access to shared data may result in data inconsistency.
\subsubheading{Semaphores}
Associate a semaphore S initially 1, with each shared variable (or set of shared variables). Surround corresponding critical section with \texttt{wait(S)} and \texttt{signal(S)} operations. This is a binary semaphore. Semaphore ensures mutually exclusive access to critical region.

\heading{Networking}
\subheading{Client-Server Model}
Most network applications are based on the client-server model: A server process and one or more client processes.
\subheading{TCP/IP}
Protocol = Rules for communication\\
TCP = Transmission Control Protocol. Provides communication between ports on two computers (bidirectional, point-to-point, reliable, byte stream). Uses IP (Internet Protocol) to transmit small packets of data between two IP addresses.
\subsubheading{TCP Connections}
Identified by: Source IP address, Source port number, Destination IP address, Destination port number.\\
\subsubheading{IP Addresses (v4)}
32-bit numbers. Often written in dotted decimal notation for human consumption (e.g. 130.102.2.15)
\subsubheading{Port Numbers}
16 bits: 0 - 65535. Below 1024, well known ports, reserved for standard services.
\subsubheading{Sockets}
A socket is a communication endpoint; associated with a file descriptor in UNIX - can do file I/O on socket, main distinction between regular file I/O and socket I/O is how the application ``opens'' the socket descriptors.
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sockets.png}
\texttt{socket(...)} - create a new communication end-point\\
\texttt{bind(...)} - attach a local address to a socket\\
\texttt{listen(...)} - willing to accept connections, give queue size\\
\texttt{accept(...)} - wait for a connection attempt to arrive\\
\texttt{connect(...)} - attempt to establish a connection\\
\texttt{send(...)} or \texttt{write(...)} - send data over the connection\\
\texttt{recv(...)} or \texttt{read(...)} - receive data over the connection\\
\texttt{sendto(...)} - send datagram (UDP)\\
\texttt{recvfrom(...)} - receive datagram (UDP)\\
\texttt{close(...)} - release the connection\\
\texttt{shutdown(...)} - close down one side of connection (or both sides)
\subsubheading{Creating a Socket}
\texttt{AF\_INET} - indicates that the socket is associated with Internet Protocols\\
\texttt{SOCK\_STREAM} - selects a reliable byte stream connection (TCP)
\begin{lstlisting}
int fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (fd < 0) {
    perror("Socket creation failed");
    exit(1);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubheading{Socket Address Structures}
Generic socket address:
\begin{lstlisting}
struct sockaddr {
    sa_family_t sa_family; /* protocol family */
    char sa_data[14]; /* address data */
};
\end{lstlisting}
Internet-specific socket address:
\begin{lstlisting}
struct sockaddr_in {
    sa_family_t sin_family;
    /* address family (always AF_INET) */
    in_port_t sin_port;
    /* port num in network byte order */
    struct in_addr sin_addr;
    /* IP addr in network byte order */
    unsigned char sin_zero[8];
    /* pad to sizeof(struct sockaddr) */
};
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubheading{Accepting a request}
Blocks waiting for a connection request
\begin{lstlisting}
int listenfd; /* listening descriptor */
int connfd; /* connected descriptor */
struct sockaddr_in clientaddr;
int clientlen = sizeof(clientaddr);
connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr*)
        &clientaddr, &clientlen);
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubheading{Socket Options}
Handy trick to allow us to rerun a server immediately after we kill it (usually have to wait 60 seconds)
\begin{lstlisting}
int optval = 1;
if (setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR,
        (const void *) &optval, sizeof(int))
        < 0) {
    perror("Unable to set socket option");
    exit(1);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubheading{Identifying the Client}
The server can determine the domain name and IP address of the client
\begin{lstlisting}
char hostname[128];
/* After accept has populated clientaddr,
    clientlen */
int error = getnameinfo((struct sockaddr*)
        &clientaddr, clientlen, hostname, 128,
        NULL, 0, 0);
if (!error) {
    printf(hostname);
    printf(inet_ntoa(clientaddr.sin_addr));
}
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubheading{Connected vs. Listening Descriptors}
\textbf{Listening} descriptor: End point for client connection requests, created once and exists for lifetime of the server.\\
\textbf{Connected} descriptor: End point for connection between client and server, a new descriptor is created each time the server accepts a connection.
\subheading{IP Addresses in C}
\begin{lstlisting}
typedef uint32_t in_addr_t;
/* Internet address structure */
struct in_addr {
    in_addr_t s_addr;
    /* network byte order (big-endian) */
};
\end{lstlisting}
Handy network byte-order conversion functions:
\begin{description}[nolistsep]
    \item[htonl()] convert uint32\_t from host to network byte order
    \item[htons()] convert uint16\_t from host to network byte order
    \item[ntohl()] convert uint32\_t from network to host byte order
    \item[ntohs()] convert uint16\_t from network to host byte order
\end{description}
Function for converting between binary IP addresses and dotted decimal strings:
\begin{description}[nolistsep]
    \item[inet\_aton(...)] converts a dotted decimal string to an IP address in network byte order
    \item[inet\_ntoa(...)] converts an IP address in network byte order to its corresponding dotted decimal string
\end{description}
\subheading{Testing Servers Using netcat}
\texttt{nc <host> <portnumber>} - creates a connection with a server running on \texttt{<host>} and listening on port \texttt{<portnumber>}\\
\texttt{nc -l -p <portnumber>} - create a netcat server
\subheading{Iterative Server}
Iterative servers process one request as a time
\subheading{Pros and Cons of ...}
\subsubheading{Process Based Design}
+ Handles multiple connections concurrently\\
+ Simple and straightforward\\
- Additional overhead for process control\\
- Nontrivial to share data between processes (Requires IPC mechanisms)
\subsubheading{Thread Based Design}
+ Easier to share data between threads (may need mutexes/semaphores)\\
- Do have thread overhead\\
\subheading{Event-Based Concurrent Servers}
Maintain a set of connected descriptors and service each as new data arrives. Repeat the following forever:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Use the Unix \texttt{select()} function to block until:
    \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
        \item new connection request arrives on the listening descriptor, or
        \item new data arrives on an existing connected descriptor
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If 1. add the new connection to the pool of connections
    \item If 2. read any available data from the connection (close connection on EOF and remove it from the set)
\end{itemize}
\subsubheading{select}
\texttt{int select(int maxfdp1, fd\_set *readset, NULL, NULL, NULL)} - sleeps until one or more file descriptors in the set are ready for reading.\\
\texttt{readset} - opaque bit vector that indicates membership in a descriptor set. If bit k is 1, descriptor k is a member of the descriptor set\\
\texttt{maxfdp1} - maximum descriptor in descriptor set plus 1\\
Returns the number of ready descriptors and sets each bit of \texttt{readset} to indicate the ready status of corresponding descriptor.
\subsubheading{Manipulating Set Descriptors (Macros)}
\texttt{void FD\_ZERO(fd\_set *fdset)} - turn off all bits in \texttt{fdset}\\
\texttt{void FD\_SET(int fd, fd\_set *fdset)} - turn on bit \texttt{fd} in \texttt{fdset}\\
\texttt{void FD\_CLR(int fd, fd\_set *fdset)} - turn off bit \texttt{fd} in \texttt{fdset}\\
\texttt{int FD\_ISSET(int fd, fd\_set *fdset)} - is bit \texttt{fd} in \texttt{fdset} turned on
\subsubheading{Pros and Cons}
+ One logical control flow\\
+ Can single-step with a debugger\\
+ No process or thread control overhead\\
- More complex to code than process or thread-based designs\\
- Can be vulnerable to denial of service attack if not implemented correctly
\subsubheading{poll}
Does the same thing as select, but different interface.
\subheading{Network Layers}
Network code is written as a ``stack'' of layers. We will use the Internet (IP) stack as our example.
\subsubheading{Physical Layer}
The medium through which signals travel
\subsubheading{(Data) Link Layer (2)}
Talking to nodes which you can reach without an intermediary (Ethernet, WiFi, a node could have a number of link layer interfaces)
\subsubheading{Network Layer (3)}
Communicating with any host on the ``internet''. Two tasks: find a node closer to the destination, send the packet in that direction (delegated to the link layer). The protocol for this layer is the Internet Protocol or IP. The address at this layer is the IP address.
\subsubheading{Transport Layer (4)}
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Connction oriented
    \item Stream based
    \item Delivery is reliable; In order, nothing missing, no duplicates
\end{itemize}
User Datagram Protocol
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Connectionless
    \item Message based (think post card)
    \item ``unreliable''
\end{itemize}
If you don't mind messages going missing UDP is faster (no acknowledgment). TCP will not move on until the current part of the stream has been delivered.
\subsubheading{Application Layer (5)}
Layer 5 is everything that builds on Layer 4, i.e. any program or application.
\subheading{IP Header}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{header.png}
\textbf{Protocol:} 8 bits, identifies higher level protocol to which packet should be passed (e.g. 6 = TCP, 17 = UDP)\\
\textbf{Source and Dest. Addresses:} 32 bits each\\
\textbf{Version:} 4 bits, Currently v4 (v6 around also but uses a different header)\\
\textbf{Total Length:} 16 bits, datagram length, max length = 65535 bytes, in reality datagrams are ofter limited by the underlying physical network\\
\textbf{Time-to-live:} 8 bits, decremented at each router, was supposed to count seconds, in practice counts hops, discarded when zero
\subsubheading{traceroute}
traceroute uses the ICMP protocol with varying Time-to-live values. Expired messages return to the program to work out the route taken.

\heading{Ways for Creating Concurrent Flows}
\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
    \item Processes
    \begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
        \item Kernel automatically interleaves multiple logical flows
        \item Each flow has its own private address space
    \end{itemize}
    \item Threads
    \begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
        \item Kernel automatically interleaves multiple logical flows
        \item Each flow shares the same address space
    \end{itemize}
    \item I/O multiplexing with \texttt{select()}
    \begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
        \item User manually interleaves multiple logical flows
        \item Each flow shares the same address space
        \item Popular for high-performance server designs
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\heading{IP Addresses}
\subheading{Classful addressing}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{classes.png}
Addresses with all 0's means this network or host, an address with all 1's means all hosts on indicated network
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{specialIP.png}
\subheading{Forwarding/Routing}
Each entry associated with network interface to send packet out on: Process is called forwarding (Note: Each router interface has different IP address), routing is the process of building up the tables of information.\\
If network not listed - packet sent to some default router. Routers only need to know about local hosts and some other networks
\subheading{Forwarding and Subnets}
Forwarding table entries - slightly different from: this-network-num.subnet-num.0 or this-network-num.this-subnet-num.host\\
Router on subnet k knows how to send packets to other subnets and send packets to hosts on subnet k. Subnet k router doesn't need to know about hosts on other subnets.\\
Forwarding table sometimes called routing table
\subsubheading{Subnet masks}
Mask that removes host-id when ANDed with address (bitwise AND).
% TODO: Add examples here
\subsubheading{Non-routable IPs}
Address Allocation for Private Internets\\
$10.0.0.0\rightarrow10.255.255.255$,
$172.16.0.0\rightarrow172.31.255.255$,
$192.168.0.0\rightarrow192.168.255.255$
\subheading{CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing}
A,B,C classful networks too inflexible. IP address blocks now allocated in a classless manner using a hierarchy of registries. Networks expressed as base IP address/N where N is the number of bits identifying the network part of the address.
\subheading{CIDR and Routing}
ISPs can allocate blocks of addresses within the blocks that have been allocated to them. Routers outside the ISP only need to know about the common prefix. This is called routing prefix aggregation, or supernetting or route summarization.
\subheading{NAT - Network Address Translation}
An approach to shortage of IP addresses.
Basic idea:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Assign an entity (organization) a single IP address
    \item Use unique, private IP addresses within organization (these same addresses can be used within multiple organizations)
    \item Change private IP address into organization's IP address when packet leaves network
\end{itemize}
Three ranges of private IP addresses exist. Private IP address must not appear on Internet
\subsubheading{Addresses on the Network}
Ethernet doesn't understand IP addresses. Actually need to send info with MAC address. Ways of mapping IP addresses to LAN addresses:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Static - have a configuration file or table
    \item Dynamic - ask over the network
\end{itemize}

    \item Windows - NTFS, FAT, FAT32
    \item Solaris - UFS (Unix File System)
    \item Linux - ext2, ReiserFS. ext3, ext4, btrfs
    \item BSD - FFS (Fast File System)
    \item Optical disks - ISO09660, Joliet extensions, UDF
\end{itemize}
\subheading{File Attributes}
Each file usually associated with attributes or meta-data:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Name - human readable
    \item Type - Some systems determine this from name or contents of file
    \item Location - where is it on the device
    \item Size
    \item Protection - who has what permissions
    \item Owner
    \item Time and date information
\end{itemize}
Particular attributes stored can vary by OS (can vary by file system)
\subsubheading{File Types}
How is type of file determined?
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Windows - Based on filename extension
    \item Macintosh (HFS) - 4 character type stored as meta-data e.g. MSWD is ``Microsoft Word''
    \item Unix - Contents of first part of file (magic number). See \texttt{/etc/magic}
\end{itemize}
\subsubheading{Protection}
Os must allow users to control access to files (Grant or deny access to file operations depending on protection information)\\
Access lists and groups (Windows - NTFS)
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Access list for each file with user name and access type
    \item Lists can become large and tedious to maintain
\end{itemize}
Access control bits (UNIX)
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Three categories of user (user, group, others)
    \item Three types of access privileges (read, write, execute)
    \item One bit per operation (11110100 = rwxr-x---)
    \item Unix also supports ACLs
\end{itemize}
\subheading{Directories}
OS (file system) uses numbers, e.g. index number of sector number.\\
People prefer names.\\
OS provides directory to map names to file numbers.
\subsubheading{Hierarchical File Systems}
Tree-structured name space (Used by all modern operating systems).\\
Top level:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item root directory (UNIX)
    \item drive names / UNC paths (Windows)
    \item volume names (MacOS - not Mac OS X)
\end{itemize}
Tree-structured name space:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Directory becomes special file on disk
    \item User programs may read directories, but only system may manipulate directories
    \item Each directory contains (name, index number) pairs\\
    Names need not be unique in whole file system, name must be unique in that directory
\end{itemize}
\subheading{Mounting File Systems}
File systems must be mounted before use (Complete directory structure may actually be built out of multiple file systems)\\
Mounting involves associating a file system device (e.g. disk partition) with a mount point
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Mount point is the pathname at which the root of the mounted file system appears
    \item Windows - drive letters
    \item Unix - more arbitrary mount points
\end{itemize}
\subheading{Links in UNIX}
\subsubheading{Hard Links (UNIX: ln command)}
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Allows multiple links to single file
    \item Example: ``ln A B''\\
    initially: A -> file number 100\\
    after: A, B -> file number 100 (i.e. multiple names for the same file)
    \item Can't link across file systems
    \item OS maintains reference counts\\Deletes file only after last link to is is deleted
\end{itemize}
Problem: users could create circular links with directories (Reference counting can't reclaim cycles)\\
Solution: can't hard link directories
\subsubheading{Soft (symbolic) links (UNIX: ln -s)}
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Makes a symbolic pointer from one file to another
    \item ``ln -s A B''\\
    initially: A -> file \#100\\
    after: A -> file \#100, B -> A
    \item Removing B does not affect A
    \item Removing A: dangling pointer
\end{itemize}
Problem: Circular links can cause infinite loops (e.g. list all files in directory and its subdirectories)\\
Shortcuts in Windows are a similar concept (not the same)
\subheading{File Sharing}
Sharing may occur over a network\\
Distributed File System
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Remote file system directories are visible locally, e.g. via some mount point
    \item NFS (Sun's Network File System)\\
    Widely used in UNIX world
    \item CIFS (Common Internet File System)\\
    Windows
\end{itemize}

\heading{Disk Drives}
Consist of multiple rotating disks:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Each disk contains concentric tracks
    \item Each track consists of multiple sectors (Bits laid out serially)
    \item Sector typically 512 bytes (plus preamble, error correction etc)
\end{itemize}
\subheading{Cost of Disk Operations}
In addition to CPU time to start disk operation:
\textbf{Latency:} time to initiate disk transfer
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item \textbf{Seek time:} time to position head over correct cylinder
    \item \textbf{Rotational time:} time for correct sector to rotate until under disk head
\end{itemize}
In most cases, disk latency will be some number of milliseconds\\
\textbf{Bandwidth:} rate of I/O transfer of sectors once initiated
\subheading{(free space) Fragmentation}
\textbf{Internal} Fragmentation - Space allocated byt not used (e.g. allocations of 4kbyte disk blocks - a 5kbyte file will be allocated 2 block (8kbytes) - 3kbytes wasted)\\
\textbf{External} Fragmentation - Unallocated spaces are too small to be useful, or too spread out

\heading{Disks and FS}
\textbf{Disks:}
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Reads and writes occur in terms of whole sectors
    \item Minimum unit of transfer
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Filesystems:}
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item File system maps file blocks to disk location\\
    e.g. file 7, block 0 maps to cylinder 1, head 3, sector 6
    \item A file block might not be the same size as a disk sector
\end{itemize}
\subheading{On-Disk Data Structures}
Most systems fit following profile:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Most files are small
    \item Most disk space taken up by large files
    \item I/O operations target both small and large
\end{itemize}
Per-file cost must be low, but large files must also have good performance\\
Some possible structures:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Contiguous allocation (too simple for our purposes)
    \item Linked Files
    \item Indexed File
\end{itemize}
\subsubheading{Linked Files}
Maintain list of all free sectors/blocks\\
In directory entry, keep pointer to first sector/block\\
In each sector, keep pointer to next sector
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{LinkedFile.png}
\textbf{Pros and Cons}\\
Advantages:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item No external fragmentation
    \item Easily handles file size changes
    \item Good for sequential access
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Random access is slow - have to follow the chain of pointers (number of disk seeks required may be large)
    \item Space taken by pointers (can use clusters of disk blocks and have one pointer per cluster (but increases internal fragmentation))
\end{itemize}
Variation: FAT (File Allocation Table)
\subsubheading{Indexed Files}
OS keeps array of block pointers for each file\\
User or OS declares maximum length of file created\\
OS allocates array (index block) to hold pointers to all blocks when it creates file (But allocates blocks themselves only on demand)\\
OS fills pointers as it allocates blocks
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{indexAllocation.png}
\textbf{Pros and Cons}\\
Advantages
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Sequential and random access: easy (i.e. quick to determine which disk block to read next)
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Sets maximum file size
    \item Lots of seeks (Data blocks may be spread out over disk)
\end{itemize}
Many variations possible

\heading{UNIX file system example}
Each directory entry contains 14 block pointers\\
First 12 pointers point to data blocks\\
13th pointer: one indirection (Points to block of 1024 pointers to 1024 more data blocks)\\
14th pointer: two indirections (Pointers to block of pointers to indirect blocks)\\
USed in BSD UNIX 4.3\\
Variants used in other UNIXes (Directory entries refer to inodes.)\\

\end{itemize}
Disadvantages
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Indirect access: inefficient for random access to very large files

    \item Block sizes
    \item Free space management
    \item Journalling
    \item Snapshots
    \item Sparse allocation
